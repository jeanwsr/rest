//! Basis-pair-screened in-core RI-J and RI-K kernels.
//!
//! The in-core RI path stores the metric-transformed three-center tensor `rimatr` with shape
//! `[nbaspar, naux]` (column-major, one row per AO pair, `nbaspar = nao(nao+1)/2`). Both Fock
//! contractions are linear in that row index, so a pair whose row cannot contribute may be
//! skipped:
//!
//! `text
//! J:  g[P] = sum_p w_p R[p,P]         (density contraction, w_p = 2 D_p, or D_p on the diagonal)
//!     J[p] = sum_P R[p,P] g[P]        (back contraction)
//!
//! K:  T[mu,i] = sum_lambda R_P[mu,lambda] C[lambda,i]   (per auxiliary function P, C = C_occ sqrt(occ))
//!     K      += T T^t
//! `
//!
//! Two screening levels act on that row index.
//!
//! **Storage level** ([`prune_rimatr`]) drops the rows of a freshly built tensor whose static
//! bound `q[p] = max_P |R[p,P]|` falls below `tol` times the largest bound. The criterion is
//! geometric, so the retained row set is fixed for a geometry and can be reused by every SCF
//! iteration; the compacted tensor carries its own row description, the [`PairMap`]. The
//! full-space tables `basbas2baspar` and `baspar2basbas` keep their meaning untouched, and the
//! pruned kernels address the tensor through the map.
//!
//! **Iteration level** ([`get_vj_pair_screened`], [`get_vk_pair_screened`]) drops the stored
//! rows that cannot contribute *at this density or with these orbitals*:
//!
//! - **J** drops a row of the density contraction when `|w_p| q[p]` falls below the threshold
//!   relative to `max_p |w_p| q[p]`, and a row of the back contraction when `q[p]` falls below
//!   the threshold relative to `max_p q[p]` (the quantity that contraction actually forms).
//! - **K** drops a row when `q[p] max(W_mu, W_nu)` falls below the threshold relative to its own
//!   maximum, with `W_mu = max_i |C[mu,i]|`. The retained rows define the *active* AO subset
//!   `A`; each auxiliary function is then contracted on that subset only, accumulated into a
//!   `|A| x |A|` `dsyrk` accumulator, and scattered back into the full symmetric matrix.
//!
//! Both kernels only ever *drop* contributions whose bound is below the threshold, and a
//! threshold of `0.0` keeps every stored row. The J kernel always returns the packed upper
//! triangle of the **full** pair space: dropped rows contribute zeros, so the caller keeps
//! assembling the Fock matrix with the unmodified `basbas2baspar`.
